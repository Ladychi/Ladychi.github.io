This repository displays my progress in The bootstrap course Mega Course from Metropolia. This repository contains the code files which were a part of the course exercises.

The repository is still in the building stage and will be complete soon. The mini projects that are a part of the course will be hosted as different repositories, links of which shall soon be updated below, as I progress further in the course.
